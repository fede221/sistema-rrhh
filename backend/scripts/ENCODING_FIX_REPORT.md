# üîß UTF-8 Encoding Fix Report

## Problem Summary
The database was using `latin1` (ISO-8859-1) charset instead of `utf8mb4`, causing company names with special characters (√±, √°, √©, etc.) to be stored and displayed incorrectly.

**Example corruption:**
- Should display: "Compa√±√≠a" 
- Actually displays: "Compa√É∆í√Ü'√É‚Äö√Ç¬±√É∆í√Ü'√É‚Äö√Ç¬≠a"

## Root Cause
- Database was created with `latin1` charset (not UTF-8)
- Data containing Spanish/special characters was interpreted incorrectly
- When connection was set to `utf8mb4`, old `latin1` data was read as UTF-8, causing mojibake
- Bytes were corrupted through multiple encoding misinterpretations

## Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Database Charset Migration (COMPLETED)
- Executed: `ALTER DATABASE RRHH CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci`
- Converted all 17 tables from `latin1_swedish_ci` to `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`
- **Status**: ‚úì Database now uses UTF-8

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 2: Data Recovery (PARTIALLY FAILED)
- Attempted to recover corrupted company names using MySQL CONVERT functions
- The data corruption was too severe (multiple encoding layers with lost bytes)
- Recovery would require original backup with correctly-stored names
- **Recommendation**: For critically corrupted names, manually re-enter them or restore from backup

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Future Prevention
- Backend `config/db.js` already sets `charset: 'utf8mb4'` on connection
- Backend runs `SET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci` on each connection
- All new data will be stored and retrieved correctly

## Database Status

### Before Fix
```
Database charset: latin1 (latin1_swedish_ci)
Tables affected: 15/17 (2 were already utf8mb4)
Data corruption: Yes (empresa names showing mojibake)
```

### After Fix
```
Database charset: utf8mb4 (utf8mb4_unicode_ci)
Tables affected: 17/17 (all converted)
New data integrity: ‚úì Guaranteed
```

## Affected Data
Companies with corrupted names (requires manual re-entry or restore from backup):
- ID 2: Should be "Compa√±√≠a Integral de Alimentos SA"
- ID 6: Should be "COMPA√ë√çA RIONEGRINA DE ALIMENTOS S.A.S" (has lost bytes - ‚úì not recoverable)

## Verification Steps
1. Restart the backend server to reload connection pool
2. Check Gesti√≥n de Empresas module in UI
3. New company entries will display correctly
4. Existing companies with simple ASCII names (Carnes Norte, Caterind, Total Food, COOKERY) display fine

## Scripts Created
- `backend/scripts/fix-encoding-auto.js` - Automatic database UTF-8 conversion
- `backend/scripts/repair-mojibake.js` - Attempted data recovery (reference)
- `backend/scripts/check-hex.js` - Diagnostic tool to check hex encoding

## Prevention for Future
1. **Backend already configured** - No code changes needed
2. **Environment** - Ensure `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` point to correct database
3. **New deployments** - Database creation scripts should use:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE rrhh_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   ```

## Recommendation
‚úÖ **Deploy** - Database is now fixed for new data
‚ö†Ô∏è **Manual action** - For users who need the corrupted company names restored:
   1. Option A: Restore from backup and re-run the encoding fix
   2. Option B: Manually re-enter the 2 affected company names in the UI

## Restart Required
After this fix, you **MUST restart the backend** for the changes to take effect:
```bash
# Stop the backend
npm run stop:backend

# Start the backend
npm run dev:backend
```
